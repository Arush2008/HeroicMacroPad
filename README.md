# HeroicMacroPad
Its a 9 key macropad with 2 rotatory switches which will be used to do different tasks like changing the britness, sound and some vs code shortcuts to make the work flow batter.


# Why I choose to make this 
I have been stugling using some of the features which waste a lot of time while I am doing stuff and those stuff make me less productive doing my work so I want to make a macropad and want it to be in my desk which will help me a lot and it looks soo cool as well when its on the desk. I am making my own customized which is more batter as I can customize all the buttons more detailed and can have the same number of buttons that I need.
